Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform allows DevOps teams to define, manage, and scale infrastructure in a repeatable and reliable way.  
Writing Terraform isn‚Äôt just about ‚Äúmaking it work‚Äù‚Äîit‚Äôs about making it consistent, secure, and easy to maintain.

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Version Control (GitOps Mindset)
- Keep Terraform code in Git repositories.
- Follow branching strategies (`main`, `develop`, feature branches).
- Use pull requests for code reviews.

### 2. Keep Code Modular
- Break large Terraform files into modules (VPC, EC2, RDS).
- Reuse modules across environments.
- Publish reusable modules in a private registry or Git repo.

### 3. Naming Conventions & Tags
- Use consistent naming (`project-env-role`).
- Apply tags like Owner, Environment, CostCenter.

### 4. Remote State Management
- Use remote backends (S3 + DynamoDB, GCS, Terraform Cloud).
- Enable state locking.

### 5. Secrets Management
- Don‚Äôt hardcode secrets.
- Use secret managers (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
- Reference secrets securely via variables.

### 6. Linting & Formatting
- Run `terraform fmt` for consistent code.
- Use `terraform validate` to catch errors early.
- Integrate static analysis tools like Checkov or tflint.

### 7. Plan Before Apply
- Always run `terraform plan` before `terraform apply`.
- Review changes carefully.
- Consider approval workflows in CI/CD pipelines.

### 8. Manage Environments Properly
- Separate state files for dev, staging, prod.
- Avoid sharing state across environments.
- Use workspaces only for identical environments.

### 9. Documentation & Collaboration
- Document modules with README.md.
- Use variable descriptions and examples.
- Share knowledge to avoid single points of failure.

### 10. Security & Least Privilege
- Follow least privilege for IAM roles.
- Rotate credentials regularly.
- Use policy-as-code tools (OPA, Sentinel) to enforce rules.

### Terraform CLI Tips
- Format Everything: `terraform fmt`
- Validate Before Deploy: `terraform validate`
- Lint for Best Practices: `tflint`
- Scan for Security: Checkov
- Auto-Generate Docs: `terraform-docs`

üí° Pro Tip: Add these checks to CI/CD pipelines to ensure consistent, secure, and reliable infrastructure.

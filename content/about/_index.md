Welcome to my personal blog, **I’m Abdul Malik Ibikunle**.  
I’m a passionate **DevOps Engineer** with a solid foundation in **Information Technology**.  
Over the past 1 year, I’ve cultivated expertise in automation, cloud infrastructure, and observability — with hands-on experience across AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform, and more.

My path into technology was sparked during a challenging time using learning as a creative escape. What started with exploring Linux and scripting soon blossomed into a love for infrastructure and automation. Since then, I have dedicated myself to mastering tools and workflows that simplify complex systems and empower teams to deliver software reliably.

 **WHAT I DO DAILY**

I focus on building reliable and scalable systems while making workflows smoother for engineering teams. My daily activities include:

- **Designing and managing scalable infrastructure** using cloud platforms like **AWS, GCP, and Azure**  
- **Automating deployments and workflows** with **Terraform, Ansible**, and CI/CD pipelines  
- **Containerizing applications and orchestrating services** with **Docker** and **Kubernetes**  
- **Monitoring and enhancing observability** using **Prometheus, Grafana, ELK/Zabbix**  
- **Continuous learning and experimentation**: building personal tools, exploring new tech, or hitting the gym  

I particularly enjoy **streamlining processes**, troubleshooting technical issues, and sharing knowledge through blog posts.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform allows DevOps teams to define, manage, and scale infrastructure in a repeatable and reliable way.  
Writing Terraform isn’t just about “making it work”—it’s about making it consistent, secure, and easy to maintain.

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Version Control (GitOps Mindset)
- Keep Terraform code in Git repositories.
- Follow branching strategies (`main`, `develop`, feature branches).
- Use pull requests for code reviews.

### 2. Keep Code Modular
- Break large Terraform files into modules (VPC, EC2, RDS).
- Reuse modules across environments.
- Publish reusable modules in a private registry or Git repo.

### 3. Naming Conventions & Tags
- Use consistent naming (`project-env-role`).
- Apply tags like Owner, Environment, CostCenter.

### 4. Remote State Management
- Use remote backends (S3 + DynamoDB, GCS, Terraform Cloud).
- Enable state locking.

### 5. Secrets Management
- Don’t hardcode secrets.
- Use secret managers (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
- Reference secrets securely via variables.
